	<h2>Fun Facts About Munji</h2>

	<h3>Munji's Zodiac Sign</h3>
	<p>Munji Chung was born on March 17th, 2021. That makes Munji a Pisces, although she is almost an Aries. According to pinkvilla.com, this makes a person a “go-getter...intuitive, impulsive, and imaginative.” Munji definitely exhibits these unique characteristics. She explores my apartment day and night, snooping around for new smells and sights. She’s also very impulsive, which she exhibits by frequently switching between cuddly and aggressive moods. As for imagination, Munji loves to play with her toys and imagine she is hunting in the wild. The few times she has been outside have been more than enough to fuel her active daydreams. </p>

	<h3>Munji the Little Tiger</h3>
	<p>Munji is a tabby cat. There are five types of tabby cats, and they are distinguished by their coat pattern (https://www.catster.com/cats-101/tabby-cat). Munji is a mackerel tabby with narrow stripes that run down her body like a little tiger. She has one white toe on each of her front paws, which I like to call her “accent nail.” Her two back feet are white, making it look like she is wearing socks. She also has a white collar at her neck, and a white and light brown belly. </p>
